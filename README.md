# 🌐 Unity Netcode Demo

This is a simple **Unity multiplayer demo** using **Unity Netcode for GameObjects (NGO)**.  
The project demonstrates how to create a **host-client setup** where:

- One player acts as the **Host** (server + player).
- Another player joins as a **Client**.
- Both players can connect to the same server.
- Player movement is **synchronized** across the network in real time.
